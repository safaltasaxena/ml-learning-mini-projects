# 🏠 Linear Regression – House Price Prediction  

📌 A simple Machine Learning mini project demonstrating **Single-Variable (Simple) Linear Regression**  
to predict house prices based on **house area**.

---

## 📖 About  
This mini project focuses on **Simple Linear Regression**, where **one independent variable**
(area) is used to predict a continuous target variable (price).  
It was built while learning core Machine Learning fundamentals.

---

## 📊 Dataset  
The project uses a CSV dataset (`prices.csv`) containing:  
- 🏡 **Area** of the house *(independent variable)*  
- 💰 **Price** of the house *(target variable)*  

---

## ✨ Features  
- 📂 Data loading using **Pandas**  
- 📈 Scatter plot visualization  
- 🤖 Model training using **Single-Variable Linear Regression**  
- 🔮 Price prediction on new input data  

---

## ▶️ Usage  
1. 📥 Clone this repository  
2. 📓 Open `linear_regression.ipynb` in **Google Colab** or **Jupyter Notebook**  
3. ▶️ Run all cells to:  
   - Load the dataset  
   - Train the regression model  
   - Predict house prices  

---

## 🛠️ Requirements  
- 🐍 Python 3.x  
- pandas  
- numpy  
- matplotlib  
- scikit-learn  

---

## 🧠 Model  
This project implements **Simple Linear Regression**, where a single feature  
(**house area**) is used to predict **house price** using a best-fit straight line.

---

## 📈 Results  
The model successfully predicts house prices based on a single input variable,  
demonstrating the fundamental working of **Linear Regression**.
