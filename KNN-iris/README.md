# 🌸 K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) – Iris Flower Classification  

📌 A Machine Learning mini project demonstrating **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
for multi-class classification using the **Iris dataset**.

---

## 📖 About  
This project uses the classic **Iris flower dataset** to classify flowers into
three species — **Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica** — based on their physical
measurements.

The focus is on understanding **distance-based classification** using KNN and
evaluating model performance.

## 🛠️ Approach  
1. Load the Iris dataset using `sklearn`  
2. Convert dataset into a Pandas DataFrame  
3. Visualize feature relationships using scatter plots  
4. Split data into training and testing sets  
5. Train a **KNN classifier** with `k = 3`  
6. Evaluate model accuracy and performance

## ▶️ Usage  
1. 📥 Clone the repository  
2. 📓 Open the notebook in **Google Colab** or **Jupyter Notebook**  
3. ▶️ Run all cells to:
   - Load and visualize the dataset  
   - Train the KNN model  
   - Evaluate predictions
